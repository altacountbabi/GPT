# ChatGPT Windows

This tool uses the pawan.krd reverse proxy, you will need an api key from their [discord](https://discord.gg/pawan-krd-1055397662976905229)

Now that you have your api key and have it downloaded and built, you will need to create 2 new files in the build output directory:

api_key.txt (containing your api key)<br>
username.txt (how the ai should call you)


Now you can open the GPT.exe file and toggle the chat window with Windows Key + F12, modify the source code if this keybind is already in use by other apps
